# Code Cleanup and Maintenance Specification

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive code cleanup and maintenance process for the Wendeal Dashboard project. The goal is to perform a complete audit of the existing codebase, identify and remove dead/invalid code, fix syntax errors, and eliminate unused functionality that doesn't contribute to the user experience.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This maintenance work supports the product vision by:
- Improving code quality and maintainability
- Reducing technical debt
- Enhancing application performance
- Simplifying the codebase for better developer experience
- Ensuring only functional, tested code remains in production

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Audit and Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform a comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify issues and unused code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit process starts THEN the system SHALL scan all TypeScript/JavaScript files for:
   - Unused imports
   - Unused variables and functions
   - Dead code paths
   - Missing dependencies
   - Circular dependencies

2. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL identify:
   - Components not rendered anywhere
   - Unused component props
   - Orphaned component files
   - Components with broken dependencies

3. WHEN checking routes THEN the system SHALL verify:
   - All route definitions are valid
   - Route components exist and are functional
   - Route guards work correctly
   - No broken navigation links

### Requirement 2: Syntax and Type Error Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix all syntax and type errors in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking TypeScript files THEN the system SHALL detect:
   - Type errors and inconsistencies
   - Missing type annotations
   - Incorrect import/export statements
   - Generic type issues

2. WHEN validating JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL check for:
   - Syntax errors
   - Undefined variables
   - Incorrect function calls
   - Missing semicolons or brackets

3. WHEN running linters THEN the system SHALL:
   - Execute ESLint with all rules enabled
   - Check Prettier formatting consistency
   - Validate code style compliance

### Requirement 3: Unused Feature Removal

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to remove features that are not being used or displayed to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying unused features THEN the system SHALL:
   - Find components not referenced in routing
   - Locate services not injected anywhere
   - Identify utilities not imported by any module
   - Discover pages not linked in navigation

2. WHEN analyzing feature usage THEN the system SHALL check:
   - Feature flags that are always disabled
   - Conditional rendering that never executes
   - API endpoints not called by frontend
   - Database tables not queried

3. WHEN removing unused code THEN the system SHALL:
   - Safely delete identified unused files
   - Update import statements to remove unused imports
   - Clean up configuration files
   - Update documentation references

### Requirement 4: Build and Runtime Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the cleaned codebase builds and runs correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL:
   - Successfully compile TypeScript without errors
   - Pass all ESLint checks
   - Build production bundle without warnings
   - Start development server without runtime errors

2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL:
   - Execute all unit tests successfully
   - Pass integration tests
   - Complete E2E test suite without failures
   - Maintain test coverage above 80%

3. WHEN validating functionality THEN the system SHALL:
   - Load all pages without errors
   - Execute all user workflows
   - Verify API integrations work
   - Confirm all features function as expected

### Requirement 5: Documentation Update

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the documentation to reflect the cleaned codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is removed THEN the system SHALL:
   - Update README files to remove references to deleted features
   - Clean up API documentation
   - Update component documentation
   - Remove references to deleted files

2. WHEN functionality changes THEN the system SHALL:
   - Update usage examples
   - Revise installation instructions
   - Update troubleshooting guides
   - Refresh feature descriptions

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Code audit should complete within 30 minutes
- Build time should not increase after cleanup
- Bundle size should decrease or remain stable
- Runtime performance should improve or stay the same

### Reliability
- No functionality should be broken during cleanup
- All existing tests should continue to pass
- Error handling should remain robust
- Application stability should be maintained

### Maintainability
- Code should be easier to understand after cleanup
- Import statements should be cleaner
- File structure should be more logical
- Dependencies should be more focused

### Security
- No security vulnerabilities should be introduced
- Authentication mechanisms should remain intact
- Authorization checks should continue to work
- Sensitive data handling should be preserved
