# TypeScript Error Fixes - Requirements

## Overview
Fix all TypeScript compilation errors that are preventing the project from building successfully. The errors span multiple files and include type mismatches, missing properties, unused imports, and configuration issues.

## User Stories

### EARS Requirements

**Event-Driven Requirements:**
- When the TypeScript compiler runs `npm run build`, it should complete without errors
- When developers run `npx tsc --noEmit`, all type checking should pass

**Actor-Driven Requirements:**
- As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors resolved so I can build the project
- As a CI/CD system, I want the build to pass without TypeScript compilation errors
- As a code reviewer, I want clean TypeScript code without unused imports or variables

**State-Driven Requirements:**
- Given that the project has TypeScript strict mode enabled, all code should comply with strict type checking
- Given that `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` is enabled, optional properties should be properly typed
- Given that `erasableSyntaxOnly: true` is enabled, no runtime enums should be used

**Stimulus-Response Requirements:**
- When I add new code, it should not introduce TypeScript errors
- When I modify existing interfaces, related code should be updated accordingly

## Functional Requirements

### Core Error Categories

1. **DiagnosticReport Interface Issues**
   - Missing `summary`, `scanTime`, `issuesFound` properties
   - Type mismatches in property assignments

2. **Configuration Type Errors**
   - Invalid severity values ("info" instead of IssueSeverity enum)
   - Missing required properties in configuration objects
   - Incorrect property types in config objects

3. **Import and Export Issues**
   - Missing exports from type definition files
   - Unused imports and variables
   - Incorrect module paths

4. **Type Compatibility Issues**
   - Union type mismatches with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
   - Interface property type conflicts
   - Generic type parameter issues

5. **Component Prop Issues**
   - Missing required props in React components
   - Incorrect prop types
   - Optional prop handling issues

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Build time should not increase significantly
- Type checking should remain fast

### Maintainability
- Code should remain readable and well-structured
- Type safety should be maintained or improved
- No TypeScript `any` types should be introduced

### Compatibility
- All fixes should maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- TypeScript version compatibility maintained

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` reports zero errors
- [ ] All TypeScript strict mode rules are satisfied
- [ ] No unused imports or variables remain
- [ ] All interfaces and types are properly defined
- [ ] Code maintains type safety throughout
