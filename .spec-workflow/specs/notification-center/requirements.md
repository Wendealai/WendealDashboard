# Notification Center Requirements

## Overview
The notification center module needs to be redesigned with full English localization and realistic notification logic system. Currently using mock data, we need to implement actual notification logic with proper data flow and user interactions.

## User Stories

### US1: Multi-language Support
**As a** user with different language preferences
**I want** the notification center to be fully localized in English
**So that** I can understand all notifications and interface elements clearly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All UI text must be in English
- Date/time formatting follows English conventions
- Error messages and confirmations are in English
- No Chinese characters in the interface

### US2: Realistic Notification Data
**As a** system administrator
**I want** the notification system to generate realistic notifications based on actual system events
**So that** users receive meaningful and contextual notifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Notifications are generated from real system events (user actions, system updates, etc.)
- Notification content is contextual and informative
- Notification timestamps reflect actual creation times
- Different notification types have appropriate content structures

### US3: Notification Categories and Types
**As a** user
**I want** notifications to be categorized by type and priority
**So that** I can quickly identify important notifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System notifications (updates, maintenance, security)
- User activity notifications (mentions, replies, follows)
- Content notifications (new reports, updates, comments)
- Priority levels: low, medium, high, urgent
- Visual indicators for different categories

### US4: Real-time Notification Updates
**As a** user
**I want** to receive real-time notifications for important events
**So that** I stay informed about system activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Push notifications for critical events
- Notification badge showing unread count
- Auto-refresh of notification list

### US5: Notification Management
**As a** user
**I want** to manage my notifications effectively
**So that** I can organize and prioritize my information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mark notifications as read/unread
- Archive old notifications
- Bulk operations (mark all read, delete selected)
- Filter by type, status, date range
- Search within notifications

### US6: Notification Settings
**As a** user
**I want** to customize my notification preferences
**So that** I only receive relevant notifications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Enable/disable notification types
- Set quiet hours
- Choose notification channels (in-app, email, push)
- Configure notification frequency
- Category-specific settings

### US7: Notification Analytics
**As a** system administrator
**I want** to track notification engagement and effectiveness
**So that** I can optimize the notification system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Notification delivery statistics
- User engagement metrics
- Notification type effectiveness
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting
