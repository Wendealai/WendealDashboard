# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The R&D Report module is a comprehensive document management system designed to handle HTML-based research and development reports. This feature enables users to upload, organize, read, and manage technical reports with full categorization support, reading progress tracking, and visual fidelity preservation.

The module will be implemented as an independent component that integrates seamlessly with the existing dashboard navigation system without affecting any current functionality.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the dashboard's goal of providing comprehensive business intelligence and research capabilities by adding a specialized document management system for technical reports. It enhances the platform's value by enabling systematic organization and consumption of research materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Navigation Integration

**User Story:** As a dashboard user, I want to see "R&D Report" in the left sidebar navigation, so that I can easily access the report management system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user drags HTML file to upload area THEN the system SHALL accept the file
2. WHEN user drops HTML file THEN the system SHALL validate file format and size
3. WHEN file is valid THEN the system SHALL show category selection dialog
4. WHEN user selects category (or chooses "Uncategorized") THEN the system SHALL process and store the file
5. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL display success message with file details

### Requirement 3: Category Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage report categories, so that I can organize reports according to business needs
