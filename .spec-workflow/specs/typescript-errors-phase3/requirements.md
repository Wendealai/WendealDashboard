# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the remaining TypeScript compilation errors that prevent the project from building successfully. The build currently fails with exit code 2 due to numerous type errors across multiple files and components. This feature will systematically resolve all remaining TypeScript errors to achieve a clean build.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the product vision by ensuring code quality, type safety, and maintainability. A clean TypeScript build is essential for:
- Preventing runtime errors
- Improving developer experience
- Enabling reliable deployments
- Maintaining code quality standards

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resolve Type Incompatibility Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type incompatibility errors resolved, so that the codebase compiles cleanly with strict TypeScript settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN all type incompatibility errors SHALL be resolved
2. IF a type mismatch exists THEN the types SHALL be properly aligned or converted
3. WHEN optional properties are used THEN exactOptionalPropertyTypes SHALL be respected

### Requirement 2: Clean Up Unused Imports and Variables

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused imports and variables removed, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an import is declared THEN it SHALL be used in the file
2. IF a variable is declared THEN it SHALL be referenced in the code
3. WHEN unused code exists THEN it SHALL be removed or properly utilized

### Requirement 3: Fix Component Prop Type Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React component prop types to be correctly defined, so that components work properly with TypeScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component receives props THEN the prop types SHALL match the expected interface
2. IF a component has optional props THEN they SHALL be properly typed as optional
3. WHEN props are passed to child components THEN they SHALL conform to the child's prop interface

### Requirement 4: Resolve Service Layer Type Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service layer type errors fixed, so that services work correctly with TypeScript.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service method is called THEN the parameter types SHALL match the method signature
2. IF a service returns data THEN the return type SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN services interact THEN their interfaces SHALL be compatible

### Requirement 5: Fix Diagnostic Utility Type Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all diagnostic utility type errors resolved, so that the diagnostic system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic utilities are used THEN they SHALL have correct type definitions
2. IF diagnostic functions are called THEN their parameters SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN diagnostic results are returned THEN they SHALL conform to expected interfaces

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Components, utilities, and services should be isolated and reusable
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and layers

### Performance
- Type checking should complete within reasonable time
- No performance degradation from type fixes
- Build process should remain efficient

### Security
- Type fixes should not introduce security vulnerabilities
- All type assertions should be safe and validated

### Reliability
- Type fixes should not break existing functionality
- All changes should be backward compatible where possible
- Build should succeed consistently

### Usability
- Developer experience should improve with better type safety
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Code should be more maintainable after fixes
