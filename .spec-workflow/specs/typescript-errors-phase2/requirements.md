# Requirements: Fix Remaining TypeScript Compilation Errors (Phase 2)

## Overview
After the initial round of TypeScript error fixes, the build is still failing with numerous compilation errors. This specification defines the requirements for fixing the remaining TypeScript errors to achieve a successful build.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a developer**, I want all TypeScript compilation errors to be resolved so that the project builds successfully and can be deployed.

### Secondary User Stories
**As a developer**, I want unused imports and variables to be cleaned up to maintain code quality.
**As a developer**, I want proper type safety throughout the codebase to prevent runtime errors.
**As a developer**, I want consistent type definitions across all modules.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation errors are resolved
- [ ] Build process completes successfully with exit code 0
- [ ] No new runtime errors are introduced
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code maintains type safety
- [ ] Unused imports and variables are removed
- [ ] Type definitions are consistent across modules
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions

## Error Categories to Fix

### Function Return Path Errors (TS7030)
- Functions that don't return values in all code paths
- Missing return statements in conditional logic

### Unused Code Cleanup (TS6133, TS6196)
- Remove unused imports
- Remove unused variables
- Remove unused type declarations

### Type Assignment Errors (TS2322)
- Incorrect type assignments
- Incompatible type conversions
- Property type mismatches

### Argument Type Mismatches (TS2345, TS2554)
- Wrong argument types passed to functions
- Incorrect number of arguments
- Type incompatible function calls

### Property Access Errors (TS2339, TS2551)
- Accessing non-existent properties
- Incorrect property names
- Missing property definitions

### Undefined Access Errors (TS18048, TS2532)
- Accessing potentially undefined values
- Null/undefined safety issues

### Implicit Any Types (TS7006, TS7053)
- Parameters without explicit types
- Index signatures with any types

### Strict Type Checking Issues (TS2375)
- exactOptionalPropertyTypes violations
- Strict null checking issues

### Object Literal Errors (TS2353)
- Unknown properties in object literals
- Extra properties not allowed by interfaces

### Import/Export Errors (TS2724, TS2305, TS2307)
- Missing exported members
- Incorrect import paths
- Module resolution issues

### Type Import Issues (TS1484)
- Types not imported using type-only imports
- verbatimModuleSyntax violations

### Unknown Type Errors (TS18046)
- Variables typed as unknown
- Type assertions needed

### Comparison Type Errors (TS2367)
- Type comparisons that will never match
- Overlapping type issues

### Spread Type Errors (TS2698)
- Spreading non-object types
- Invalid spread operations

### Syntax Errors (TS1294)
- erasableSyntaxOnly violations
- Invalid syntax constructs

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality
- Cannot break existing APIs
- Must follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Should preserve code readability and maintainability

## Dependencies
- Previous TypeScript error fixes must be completed
- Build system must be functional
- Type definitions must be available

## Risk Assessment
- High: Potential to introduce new errors while fixing existing ones
- Medium: Changes might affect runtime behavior
- Low: Build process improvements will enhance development experience

## Success Metrics
- Build completes successfully
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All tests pass
- No new runtime errors introduced
