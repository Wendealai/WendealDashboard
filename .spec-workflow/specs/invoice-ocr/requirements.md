# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Invoice OCR feature enables users to upload invoice documents (PDF and image formats) and automatically extract structured data using OCR technology. This feature integrates with the existing workflow dashboard to provide a seamless document processing experience with real-time progress tracking and result visualization.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature enhances the workflow automation platform by adding document processing capabilities, allowing users to digitize and extract data from invoices efficiently. It supports the platform's goal of providing comprehensive automation tools for business processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Workflow Card Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an "Invoice OCR" workflow card in the left sidebar, so that I can easily access the invoice processing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display an "Invoice OCR" card in the workflow list
2. WHEN I click on the "Invoice OCR" card THEN the system SHALL switch the right panel to show the Invoice OCR interface
3. WHEN the card is displayed THEN it SHALL include a "Run" button consistent with other workflow cards

### Requirement 2: File Upload Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload multiple invoice files (PDF and images), so that I can process multiple documents in a single workflow run.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Invoice OCR interface THEN the system SHALL display a file upload area with clear instructions for PDF and image formats
2. WHEN I upload files THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar for each file upload
3. WHEN files are uploaded successfully THEN the system SHALL display a list of uploaded files with delete options
4. WHEN I click delete on a file THEN the system SHALL remove it from the upload list
5. IF I try to upload unsupported file types THEN the system SHALL show an error message and reject the upload

### Requirement 3: Workflow Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start the Invoice OCR workflow with uploaded files, so that I can extract data from my invoices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the "Run" button (either in card or interface) AND no files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a message guiding me to upload files first
2. WHEN I click the "Run" button AND files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL send the files to the webhook endpoint `https://n8n.wendealai.com/webhook/invoiceOCR`
3. WHEN the workflow is running THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading/progress indicators
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL display the returned information in a dedicated results panel

### Requirement 4: Results Display and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the OCR results and access the processed data in Google Sheets, so that I can review and use the extracted information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL display "Workflow completed" message with the webhook response content
2. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a button to "View Results in Google Sheets"
3. WHEN I click the Google Sheets button THEN the system SHALL open `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8VGSofJUBK7yCTqtaPNQvSZ1HeGDNZOvO2UQ6SRJzg/edit?usp=sharing` in a new tab
4. WHEN results are shown THEN the system SHALL provide adequate space below the upload area for displaying response information

### Requirement 5: Workflow Settings Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure the Invoice OCR workflow settings, so that I can customize the workflow name and webhook URL if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access workflow settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to modify the "Invoice OCR" workflow name
2. WHEN I access workflow settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to modify the webhook URL (default: `https://n8n.wendealai.com/webhook/invoiceOCR`)
3. WHEN I save settings changes THEN the system SHALL update the workflow configuration and reflect changes in the interface
4. WHEN settings are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain the mapping between the workflow and its configuration

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should handle one specific aspect (upload, display, workflow execution)
- **Modular Design**: File upload, workflow execution, and results display should be separate, reusable components
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between upload logic and workflow execution
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between file handling, API communication, and UI components

### Performance
- File uploads should show progress indicators for files larger than 1MB
- The interface should remain responsive during file uploads and workflow execution
- Multiple file uploads should be handled efficiently without blocking the UI

### Security
- File type validation must be enforced on both client and server sides
- Uploaded files should be handled securely without exposing file paths
- Webhook communication should use HTTPS

### Reliability
- The system should handle network failures gracefully during file upload and workflow execution
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- The interface should recover properly from failed operations

### Usability
- File upload area should provide clear visual feedback for drag-and-drop operations
- Progress indicators should be visible and informative
- Error states should be clearly communicated to users
- The interface should be consistent with existing workflow cards and panels
