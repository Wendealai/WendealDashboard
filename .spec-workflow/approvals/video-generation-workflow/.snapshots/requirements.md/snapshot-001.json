This feature will integrate with n8n webhook services to process video generation requests and provide a seamless user experience for content creators who need to generate video content for social media platforms.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis feature supports the product vision by expanding the content creation capabilities of WendealDashboard, specifically targeting social media content creators who need efficient video generation tools. It builds upon the existing image generation workflow by adding video capabilities, creating a comprehensive media creation suite.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Video Generation Workflow Card\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a dedicated workflow card for video generation in the Social Media section, so that I can easily access video creation tools alongside other media generation features.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN user navigates to Social Media section THEN system SHALL display a \"Video Generation\" workflow card alongside existing cards\r\n2. WHEN user clicks on Video Generation card THEN system SHALL open a dedicated video generation interface\r\n3. IF video generation card is not available THEN system SHALL show appropriate loading or disabled state\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Input Interface\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to input text descriptions and upload images for video generation, so that I can specify exactly what kind of video I want to create.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN user opens video generation interface THEN system SHALL display a text input field for video description\r\n2. WHEN user opens video generation interface THEN system SHALL display an image upload component for reference images\r\n3. WHEN user enters text in description field THEN system SHALL validate input length and format\r\n4. WHEN user uploads images THEN system SHALL validate file types (jpg, png, gif) and sizes\r\n5. IF input validation fails THEN system SHALL display appropriate error messages\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Video Generation Process\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to trigger video generation that connects to n8n webhook, so that my requests are processed by the video generation service.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN user clicks generate button THEN system SHALL send request to n8n webhook endpoint\r\n2. WHEN request is sent THEN system SHALL display loading state with progress indication\r\n3. WHEN n8n webhook receives request THEN system SHALL include text description and uploaded images in the payload\r\n4. IF webhook request fails THEN system SHALL display error message and allow retry\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Results Display\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to view generated videos and download them, so that I can use the created content in my social media posts.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN video generation completes THEN system SHALL display the generated video in a video player\r\n2. WHEN video is displayed THEN system SHALL provide a download button for the video file\r\n3. WHEN user clicks download button THEN system SHALL initiate file download with appropriate filename\r\n4. IF video generation fails THEN system SHALL display error message with retry option\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should handle one aspect of video generation workflow\r\n- **Modular Design**: Video generation components should be reusable and isolated from other workflows\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize dependencies on existing image generation code\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between video generation service and UI components\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Video upload should complete within 30 seconds for files up to 10MB\r\n- Video generation requests should be processed within 2 minutes\r\n- UI should remain responsive during video generation process\r\n- Memory usage should be optimized for large video files\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Uploaded images should be validated for malicious content\r\n- Video generation requests should include proper authentication\r\n- Downloaded videos should be served securely\r\n- User data should be properly sanitized before sending to webhook\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- Video generation process should have proper error handling and recovery\r\n- Failed requests should be logged for debugging\r\n- System should gracefully handle n8n webhook unavailability\r\n- Video files should be properly cleaned up after download\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Interface should be intuitive and follow existing workflow patterns\r\n- Progress indicators should be clear and informative\r\n- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable\r\n- Video player should support common video formats",
