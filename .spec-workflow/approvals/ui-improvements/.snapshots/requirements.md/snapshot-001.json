The goal is to provide a fully English interface with proper content display and eliminate display bugs that prevent users from seeing generated content immediately.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis feature supports the product vision by improving user experience and accessibility through:\r\n- Complete English localization for international users\r\n- Immediate content display without unnecessary loading states\r\n- Proper rendering of all UI components including visual strategy sections\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Complete Chinese to English Translation\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As an international user, I want all UI text to be in English, so that I can understand the interface without language barriers.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the page loads THEN all Chinese text SHALL be replaced with English equivalents\r\n2. WHEN users interact with buttons THEN button labels SHALL be in English (\"Copy Tags\", \"Regenerate\")\r\n3. WHEN content sections are displayed THEN section headers SHALL be in English (\"Research Data\", \"Analysis Insights\", \"Alternative Versions\", \"Generation Time\", \"Generation Results\")\r\n4. IF any Chinese text remains THEN the system SHALL display an error indicating incomplete translation\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Immediate Content Display Fix\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to see generated content immediately after webhook response, so that I don't have to wait unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN webhook response is received THEN \"Publish Version\" SHALL display actual content immediately\r\n2. WHEN all content data is available THEN the system SHALL NOT show \"Content generating... Please wait for the webhook response to complete.\"\r\n3. IF content is available THEN display SHALL update within 100ms of data receipt\r\n4. WHEN content validation passes THEN users SHALL see formatted text instead of loading message\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Visual Strategy Display Fix\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a content strategist, I want to see visual strategy information properly displayed, so that I can understand visual recommendations.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN webhook response contains visual strategy data THEN the \"Visual Strategy\" section SHALL display properly\r\n2. WHEN visual_elements exist THEN they SHALL be shown in the UI\r\n3. WHEN design_notes exist THEN they SHALL be displayed with proper formatting\r\n4. IF visual strategy data is missing THEN the section SHALL be hidden gracefully\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: UI text management should be separated from business logic\r\n- **Modular Design**: Translation strings should be centralized and reusable\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between display logic and data processing\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean separation between content extraction and display\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- UI updates should complete within 100ms of data changes\r\n- No unnecessary re-renders when content is already displayed\r\n- Memory usage should remain stable during content display operations\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- No security implications for UI text changes\r\n- Content validation should prevent XSS through proper sanitization\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- Content display should work consistently across all platform tabs\r\n- Error handling should prevent UI crashes when data is malformed\r\n- Fallback mechanisms should ensure basic functionality even with incomplete data\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- All text should be clear and professional in English\r\n- Content should appear immediately when available\r\n- Visual strategy information should be easy to read and understand\r\n- Copy functionality should work reliably for all translatable elements",
