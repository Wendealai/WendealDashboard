The project currently has over 200 TypeScript errors that need to be resolved to ensure code quality, maintainability, and successful compilation. This initiative will improve developer experience, prevent runtime errors, and ensure type safety across the application.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nThis feature supports code quality and maintainability goals by ensuring type safety and preventing compilation errors that could lead to runtime issues. It aligns with the technical vision of building a robust, scalable React/TypeScript application.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1: Error Analysis and Categorization\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors to be analyzed and categorized, so that I can systematically address them by type and priority.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN TypeScript compilation is run THEN the system SHALL categorize errors by type (unused variables, type mismatches, missing properties, etc.)\r\n2. WHEN errors are categorized THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical errors (type safety violations) over non-critical ones (unused imports)\r\n3. WHEN error analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive list of all errors with file locations and descriptions\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2: Type Definition Corrections\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want incorrect type definitions to be fixed, so that the code accurately reflects the intended data structures and interfaces.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN a type mismatch error occurs THEN the system SHALL update the type definition to match the actual usage\r\n2. WHEN properties are missing from interfaces THEN the system SHALL add the required properties or make them optional\r\n3. WHEN type imports are incorrect THEN the system SHALL correct the import statements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3: Unused Code Removal\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables, imports, and functions to be removed, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN variables are declared but never used THEN the system SHALL remove the unused variable declarations\r\n2. WHEN imports are unused THEN the system SHALL remove the unused import statements\r\n3. WHEN functions have unused parameters THEN the system SHALL either use the parameters or remove them\r\n\r\n### Requirement 4: Null Safety and Optional Handling\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want null/undefined values to be properly handled, so that runtime errors are prevented.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN a value might be undefined THEN the system SHALL add proper null checks or optional chaining\r\n2. WHEN array access might be out of bounds THEN the system SHALL add bounds checking\r\n3. WHEN object properties might not exist THEN the system SHALL use optional property access\r\n\r\n### Requirement 5: Component Prop Corrections\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want component props to match their defined interfaces, so that components render correctly and type-safely.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN component props don't match the interface THEN the system SHALL update the props to match the interface\r\n2. WHEN required props are missing THEN the system SHALL add the missing props with appropriate default values\r\n3. WHEN prop types are incorrect THEN the system SHALL correct the prop types\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each fix should address one specific error type\r\n- **Modular Design**: Fixes should be isolated to the affected files without introducing new dependencies\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Changes should not break existing functionality\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Type definitions should be clear and well-documented\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Fixes should not introduce performance regressions\r\n- Type checking should complete without significant delays\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Type fixes should not introduce security vulnerabilities\r\n- Null safety improvements should prevent potential security issues\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- All fixes should be tested to ensure they resolve the specific errors\r\n- No new TypeScript errors should be introduced during the fixing process\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Error messages should be clear and actionable\r\n- Code changes should be well-commented where complex type logic is involved",
